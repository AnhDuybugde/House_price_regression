# Download pre-trained models

The pre-trained models are too large to host on GitHub.  

1. Download the models from: [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bkY-YYwWF5KIa2QVIJeQEflQrhWzMkLC?usp=sharing)
2. Extract/unzip if necessary.
3. Place the files in the folder: `experiments/models/`
4. Make sure the filenames match exactly as expected by the code/notebooks.
